A course requirement for our finals in the subject CC206 Applications Development.

## Wanderlust Simple Animated Login
-----------------------------------
Things to be considered when navigating the application:
1. The login screen contains two textfields: email and password textfield. The user must input the default values, as mentioned below, to ensure a successful login.
  >Email: cictapps@wvsu.edu.ph <br>
  >Password: toor
2. If the textfields are left empty and the user has clicked the login button, a dialog box will pop up informing the user that an email/password is required. Clicking the retry button will redirect the user to the initial state of the login screen.
3. Another dialog box will pop up if ever an incorrect email/password has been entered. The retry button will also allow the user to try and input the correct values again.
4. Once the correct email and password has been entered, the user will be directed to the home screen.
